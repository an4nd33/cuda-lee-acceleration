# cuda-lee-acceleration
GPU acceleration of Lee’s maze routing algorithm using NVIDIA CUDA. This project implements a parallel wave propagation model to compute shortest paths on large grids, compares CPU vs GPU performance, and explores memory optimization strategies for high-performance computing and VLSI routing applications.
